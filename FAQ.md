## Q: WHY CREATE mugplayer?
Answer: If you are well organized and keep your music neatly organized and love
the Apple Music player, you don't need this tool.

I don't like playing music using the Apple's default music player.
And I am not organized when it comes to my MP3 music files. So I prefer
the system to find the music using part of the title and play
it in the background while I am working on a terminal.
